    "Based on the background information and demographics of study participants, crossed analysis can be done by comparing acceptability scores of two different groups.\n",
    "One example could be to compute the mean acceptability scores of the participants that reported to have an IT background and of those who didn't. Interpreting the results could lead to interesting insights. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the average acceptability scores of sharing brain signals with the different recipients under certain conditions of those who reported to have an IT background was higher than the scores from the other group. Interpreting this would mean that the first group is more open to share their brain data. Additionally, the statistical significance by executing signed rank tests can be shown. \n",
